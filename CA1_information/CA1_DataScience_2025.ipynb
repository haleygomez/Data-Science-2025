    "Plagiarism is the act of passing off the words or ideas of others as if your own. Advice on avoiding plagiarism is given in the UG Student Handbook. There is also considerable help and advice on Learning Central and the University web site. Students need to be especially careful of plagiarism in computing tasks and you are advised not to share code through electronic means. Students working together during their weekly exercises and the coursework is great (and indeed encouraged) but you need to ensure that they you are not using each other's code or text.\n",

GenAI must not be used to write text, discussions, or interpretations. You may, however, use support tools such as dictionaries, thesauruses, or grammar/spell checkers (e.g., Grammarly), even if they are powered by GenAI. Any use of AI must be declared, as outlined in Learning Central > Assessment and Feedback."

    "A group researching cancer have previously found that the genetic marker D3 is a useful indication that a person will develop the more aggressive form of melanoma skin cancer, in that D3 is present in 65% of the aggressive cases. However the test is expensive.  A rival group claim that the marker M23 is more sensitive than D3, and works out considerably cheaper to test for. The rival research team manage to get DNA samples from 7 patients with the aggressive form of the disease, all of whom test positive for the genetic marker M23. Based on these results, is M23 a better marker for the disease than D3? \n",
