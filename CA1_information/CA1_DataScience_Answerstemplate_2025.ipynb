    "Plagiarism is the act of passing off the words or ideas of others as if your own. Advice on avoiding plagiarism is given in the UG Student Handbook. There is also considerable help and advice on Learning Central and the University web site. Students need to be especially careful of plagiarism in computing tasks and you are advised not to share code through electronic means. Students working together during their weekly exercises and the coursework is great (and indeed encouraged) but you need to ensure that they you are not using each other's code or text.\n",

    "We will follow the University’s traffic light system. This coursework is designated AMBER — you may use GenAI tools only for the computational aspect (e.g., coding cells). GenAI must not be used to write text, discussions, or interpretations. You may, however, use support tools such as dictionaries, thesauruses, or grammar/spell checkers (e.g., Grammarly), even if they are powered by GenAI. Any use of AI must be declared, as outlined in Learning Central > Assessment and Feedback."
